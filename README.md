# Sentry for WordPress

A Sentry reporting plugin for WordPress. Please check out the docs [here](https://github.com/adampatterson/sentry-for-wordpress).

This plugin was an experement using Composer and a very simple plugin structure called [Lanyard](https://github.com/adampatterson/Lanyard).

The original WordPress working guts came from [ryanbagwell / wordpress-sentry](https://github.com/ryanbagwell/wordpress-sentry) but was modified for my own needs.
